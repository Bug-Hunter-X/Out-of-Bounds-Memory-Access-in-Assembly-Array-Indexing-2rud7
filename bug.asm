mov eax, [ebx+esi*4+0x10] ; This line attempts to access memory at an invalid address. The calculation of the effective address may result in an address outside the bounds of allocated memory, leading to a segmentation fault or other unpredictable behavior.  The values of ebx, esi, and the offset 0x10 must be carefully checked to ensure that they don't result in an out-of-bounds memory access.
